# Skill Tree Editor

It's intentionally simple. The main goal was to not impose a data schema because devs know better what they need on their skill trees, so I wanted a tool that would solve the main issue of managing the data and connections between nodes.

You can use the editor in your browser on my itch [Skill Tree Editor Online](https://kirlosev.itch.io/skill-tree-editor)  

I used this tool to create my upcoming game [Screen Savior(demo)](https://kirlosev.itch.io/screen-savior)  

Here's a usage demo:

PRs for polish and UX improvements are welcome but keep them short.  
And no AI PRs too because I like coding.
